# WR_Bug-algorithms-for-robot-navigation

Repository contains three programs written in Python language. Each of them uses robotics middleware, ROS Melodic and was tested in Gazebo simulator. Programs steer robot, whose aim is to reach destination point given by user. They are implementations of Bug2, Alg2 and Rev2 algorithms which are part of path planning problem.
